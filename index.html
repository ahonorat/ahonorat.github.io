  <h1 class="page-heading">Hello!</h1>

  <p align="justify">
    I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.ietr.fr/">IETR</a> french laboratory, in the <a href="https://www.insa-rennes.fr/">INSA</a> engineering school.
    I am working on dataflow models for high throughput computing, often used to develop image processing applications on embedded systems.
    The main challenge of this Ph.D. is to automatically configure parameters of Synchronous DataFlow (SDF) graphs to ease the development of applications.
    On the software side, the SDF model is specific enough to capture interesting properties of the application, and simple enough to not become a burden for the developers.
    On the hardware side it enables scheduling applications on multi-core systems with several constraints such as latency, throughput, memory and energy consumption.
    My Ph.D. contributions are implemented in the open source <a href="https://preesm.github.io">PREESM</a> software.
