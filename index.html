  <h1 class="page-heading">Hello!</h1>

  <p align="justify">
    I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.ietr.fr/">IETR</a> french laboratory,
    working on dataflow models for high throughput computing (e.g. image processing applications).
    The main chalenge of this Ph.D. is to extend existing the Synchronous DataFlow (SDF) Model of Computation (MoC) to ease the development of embedded systems.
    On the software side it means that the model must be specific enough to capture interesting properties of the application, and simple enough to not become a burden for the developers.
    On the hardware side it must enable to schedule applications on multi-core systems with several constraints such as latency, throughput, memory and energy consumption.
